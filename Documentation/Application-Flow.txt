Unused Routes
All routes provided in the application seem to serve specific functionalities related to the food delivery application, including authentication, displaying information, managing orders, and updating the menu. Without more context about the full scope of the application or any development plans, it's not possible to definitively label any route as "unused" without risking the removal of potentially important functionality. However, it is worth noting that routes like /update_cart_session, /save_cart_and_view, /view_cart, and /confirm_order/<int:order_nr> do not have corresponding HTML templates provided, but these routes appear to handle background processes or API-like calls rather than directly serving pages.

For a more detailed analysis or to identify truly unused routes, a deeper dive into the application's frontend and how it interacts with these endpoints would be necessary.
